But for actual shagging? Fuck off. üòò`,

1. Kids arrive hyped on sugar
2. Bouncy castle deflates mid-bounce
3. Someone's mum complains about the noise

6. You question all your life choices

I'd recommend:

But seriously, mental health matters. Check out:

üîß **Emergency steps:**
‚Ä¢ Turn off the water (stop valve under sink/by toilet)
‚Ä¢ Don't use chemical drain cleaners (they make it worse)
‚Ä¢ Take photos of the problem for quotes

üí∞ **Typical costs:**
‚Ä¢ Call-out fees: ¬£80-120
‚Ä¢ Emergency rates: 1.5-2x normal prices
‚Ä¢ If they quote over ¬£200 before even looking, get a second opinion

üìû **How to find someone decent:**
‚Ä¢ Local Facebook groups (search "[your area] plumber recommendations")
‚Ä¢ Ask neighbors - seriously, old school works
‚Ä¢ Checkatrade/Rated People (yeah, I know, but they're useful)

**Red flags:** Knocks on your door randomly, asks for full payment upfront, can't show recent work photos.

*Note: This is a backup response due to network issues. The real TradeBot would roast you more creatively while giving the same advice.* üòÑ`;

‚ö° **Safety first:**
‚Ä¢ Turn off power at the fuse box if sparking/burning smell
‚Ä¢ Don't touch anything wet + electrical
‚Ä¢ Get Part P certified work for anything permanent

üí∞ **Typical costs:**
‚Ä¢ Call-out fees: ¬£60-100
‚Ä¢ Hourly rate: ¬£40-60
‚Ä¢ Always ask for a quote upfront

üìû **Finding someone qualified:**
‚Ä¢ NICEIC registered electricians (check their website)
‚Ä¢ Local recommendations from Facebook groups
‚Ä¢ Always ask to see their qualification certificates

**Red flags:** No qualifications, won't provide certificates, quotes way under market rate.

*Backup TradeBot response - the real one would be more sarcastic but equally helpful.*`;

**General advice while my brain's offline:**

üìû **Where to look:**
‚Ä¢ Local Facebook groups (search "[your area] [trade] recommendations")
‚Ä¢ Ask neighbors (old school but effective)
‚Ä¢ Checkatrade/Rated People (yeah, I know, but they work)

üîß **General tips:**
‚Ä¢ Get quotes from 3 different people
‚Ä¢ Check recent reviews, not just star ratings
‚Ä¢ Ask to see photos of recent work
‚Ä¢ Never pay full amount upfront
‚Ä¢ If they knock on your door randomly, tell them to fuck off

üí∞ **Pricing red flags:**
‚Ä¢ Quotes way above or below market rate
‚Ä¢ Asks for full payment before starting
‚Ä¢ Won't provide written quotes

*This is TradeBot's backup personality due to network issues. Same advice, less creative insults.* üòÖ`;
